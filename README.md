visual gamified representation of processes as dynamic entities with distinct memory footprints utilizing the iconic Tron Light Cycles game as a metaphor.
In this rendition, each light cycle represents an independent process, and the colorful trails left behind symbolize the memory utilization of each process.
The alphabetic keys (W,A,S,D) are used to control YELLOW trail. 
The arrow keys (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT) are used to control BLUE trail.
